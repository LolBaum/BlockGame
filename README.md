Config File
-----------
- location: `build/config.json`
- This file is created by closing BlockGame for the first time.


Building
--------

### building with Cmake
BlockGame can be build using the `CMakeLists.txt` file (tested in CLion).

Make sure the executable will be placed into `build` directory. 
Alternatively the working directory can be specified to the `build` directory.

This build process might take longer than the alternative approaches.

### Alternative Linux
following dependencies need to be installed: 
```
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglm-dev libsdl2-dev
``` 

#### Compiling
To build the Project (with g++), simply execute the `buildLinux` bash script.<br>
If the compilation was sucessfull the executable game will be at `build/mainLinux`.<br>

### Alternative Windows
The necessary dependencies `glew, glm, SDL2` are already included in this repository (`libs` directory).


#### buildWindows.sh
The `buildWindows.sh` script can be used to build the Game for Windows. All Dependecies must be located in the `libs\` directory.
It's important that all folders have the same names as in the script.
<br>

#### build_with_python.py
The `python build_with_python.py` can be used to speed up the compilation if the Project is compiled multiple times.
All compiled sources are cached in `.python_build/filehash.txt` and will only be recompiled if necessary.

### MacOS *(Work in Progress)*
